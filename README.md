# Employees Data Management
**Add, sort, filter, and display employee data**
**Based on how many employees you want to add, you will be prompted to add their => Name, Age, Department, and Salary.**\
It can filter for each department's highest salary and sort by Name, age, or Department.\
There's data validation on everything to ensure data is correct, for example, a salary can't be less than 0, a name can't be a number, and so on.\
**Tech Stack => JavaScript ES5, HTML4.**\
<ins>The project was coded during my ITI Training.</ins>
